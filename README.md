# Independent Studies Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for Independent Studies! 

## About this repository

This repository documents my journey as I explore the latest advancements in web technologies. In particular, I've been focusing on developing my skills in data structures and algorithms.

### IS1: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

In my first independent study project, I explored the concepts of data structures and algorithms, specifically the stack and linked list data structures, and the shunting yard algorithm. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to organize and manipulate data efficiently in programming. And have built a simple [Equation Solver](#equation-solver) which solves mathematical expressions.

### IS2: Further Exploring Data Structures and Algorithms

My current project involves a deeper exploration of data structures and algorithms, including tries, suffix trees, and the edit distance algorithm. I'm excited to see where this project takes me, as I'll be trying my hand at creating a Spell Checker, similar to Google's "Did you mean" functionality.

## Equation Solver

My Equation Solver is a simple calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions. It supports the following functions:

* Plus (+)
* Minus or Negative (-)
* Multiply (*)
* Divide (/)
* Brackets (())
* Power(^)

## Spell Checker

My latest project is a spell checker that aims to detect errors in spelling. The spell checker will help users identify and correct spelling errors, similar to Google's "Did you mean" functionality. I'm still in the process of developing and testing the spell checker, but I'm excited to share updates with you soon!

## Future Plans

Eventually, my goal is to create a comprehensive website that provides users with access to a range of tools and modules, including the Equation Solver and Spell Checker. To achieve this, I plan to develop a dashboard where users can explore and utilize these modules.
